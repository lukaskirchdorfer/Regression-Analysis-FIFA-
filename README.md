# Regression-Analysis-FIFA

As part of the lecture "Data Mining 1" at the University of Mannheim, we conducted a regression analysis of the FIFA dataset which was scrapped from sofifa.com.

Rough overview of the project:
1) Webscrape data
2) Data Preprocessing (missing values, encodings, get rid of signs, normalization, etc.)
3) Model building (tried various regression models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Regression Tree, Neural Network, XGBoost, etc.)
4) Hyperparameter Tuning (basic optimization for all models)
5) Evaluation based on RMSE
6) Bayesian Optimization for best model (XGBoost)
